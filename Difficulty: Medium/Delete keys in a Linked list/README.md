The function takes two arguments: the head of the linked list and an integer x. The function should&nbsp;returns the head of the modified linked list.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:
</strong>LinkedList = 2-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;4-&gt;4
x = 4
<strong>Output: 
</strong>3
2 2 1<strong> </strong>
</pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:
</strong>LinkedList = 1-&gt;2-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;2-&gt;3
x = 2
<strong>Output: 
</strong>3
1 3 3<strong>
Explanation:</strong> Given number to delete is 2.
First line of output contains the 
number of remaining elements in the list.
After deleting all occurrences of 2, we
have elements in the list as 1, 3, and 3.
